    <a href="http://origami.me/camel/"><img src="images/camel.png" width=200px height=200px></a>
    <p>There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.<br>
Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.<br>
Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.<br>
Their humps let them store up to 80 pounds of fat which they can live off for weeks and even months!<br>
When a camel finally does find water, he can drink up to 40 gallons in one go.<br>
Camels are very strong and can carry up to 900 pounds for 25 miles a day.<br>
Camels can travel at up to 40 miles per hour – the same as a racehorse!<br>
Don’t make a camel angry – they can spit as a way to distract whatever they think is a threat<br></p>

    <a href="http://origami.me/chameleon/"><img src="images/chameleon.png" width=200px height=200px></a>
    <p>THEIR FEET WORK LIKE SALAD TONGS. ...<br>
        ALMOST HALF OF ALL KNOWN SPECIES LIVE IN MADAGASCAR. ...<br>
        CHAMELEONS VARY WILDLY IN TERMS OF SIZE. ...<br>
        THEY MAINLY CHANGE COLOR IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE OR REGULATE BODY TEMPERATURE. ...<br>
        SKIN CRYSTALS ENABLE THEM TO CHANGE COLOR AT WILL. ...<br>
        UNLIKE MANY LIZARDS, CHAMELEONS CAN'T REGROW THEIR TAILS.<br>
        THEY’VE GOT A DISTINCTIVE “JERKY WALK.”<br>
        CHAMELEON SPIT IS UNBELIEVABLY STICKY.<br></p>

    <a href="http://origami.me/flying-cicada/"><img src="images/cicada.png" width=200px height=200px></a>
    <p>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. ...<br>
        The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus. ...<br>
        They're true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). ...<br>
        Most have red-orange eyes. ...<br>
        Females may be attracted to the sound of motors. ...<br>
        Their short adult life is not unusual for bugs.<br>
        Their short adult life is not unusual for bugs. The adult stage for many insects is only for finding a mate or moving to a new location.<br>
        They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate<b></b></p>

    <a href="http://origami.me/panda/"><img src="images/panda.png" width=200px height=200px></a>
    <p>A giant panda is much bigger than your teddy bear. ...<br>
        Giant pandas are good at climbing trees and can also swim. ...<br>
        Pandas go from pink to white and black (or brown). ...<br>
        Pandas have so many fans because they look cute. ...<br>
        Pandas are "lazy" — eating and sleeping make their day. ...<br>
        An adult can eat 12–38 kilos of bamboo per day!<br>
        Giant pandas can't stand and do kung fu moves like Po in Kungfu Panda. But they are good tree climbers. They can climb trees from 7 months old.<br></p>

    <a href="http://origami.me/pigeon/"><img src="images/pigeon.png" width=200px height=200px></a>
    <p>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.<br>
        Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.<br>
        Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.<br>
        Pigeons mate for life, and tend to raise two chicks at the same time.<br></p>

    <p>1.) The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.<br>
        2.) Inspired by a cartoon featuring the event, shopkeeper Morris Michtom and his wife Rose made a stuffed bear with a sign ‘Teddy’s bear’ and left it in their shop window. It gained so much attention that they started a successful toy making company.<br>
        3.) Meanwhile, in Germany in the same year, the Steiff family developed a silk-like fabric bear, based on zoo animals. They caused a sensation at a toy fair and were snapped up by an American buyer.<br></p>
